# Marketing Channel Attribution with Markov Chains in Python

Markov chains, in the context of channel attribution, gives us a framework to statistically model user journeys and how each channel factors into the users traveling from one channel to another to eventually convert (or not). By using these transition probabilities, we can identify the statistical impact a single channel has on our total conversions.

<!--
"Whiteboarded" analysis:

** similarity between two different products
Qualitative reviews

Look at different embedding technectics
Similarity metric
Similar products how accurate
100 most confident product pairs and see how accurate those are
That closes the middles

Labelling - active learning

Providing a signal to learner that the assumptions are correct (like grid searching)
50 at most to see if algorithm is working and keep going to figure out if the top similar questions is more or less good

Find that inflection point (grid searching)
- See the most accurate one,

Blog - what if we take this certain product and follow it thru the ML journey?
Flask app - put in a product?




Improvement - what does this mean for product brand? -->
